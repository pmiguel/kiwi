# ü•ù Kiwi

Kiwi is a Key-Value storage server, completely written from scratch in Go as a personal pet project ands exercise to learn the Go programming language. 

It aims to be as an alternative for Redis, and to support at least a subset of the commands provided by Redis, for familarity reasons. 
As added features, support for strong namespacing would be a nice to have addition.

## Planned work for first demo:
- Supported Commands:
  - [x] PING
  - [ ] GET
  - [ ] SET
  - [ ] KEYS
- [ ] Namespacing
- [ ] TTL
  - [ ] Simple time based
  - [ ] Counter based
  - [ ] Duration based, with refresh on hit
- [ ] Simple Auth
- Protocols:
  - [ ] Connection Handshake and protocol negociation
  - Kiwi Communication Protocol (KCP)
    - [x] V0: string marshalling to bytes for testing purposes
    - [ ] V1: Standard Kiwi Protocol V1
  - [ ] Redis RESP-compatible protocol

## Name Origin

ü•ù Kiwi in Portuguese reads as "Kivi", fonetically similar to Key-V. V in this case would stand for Value.
