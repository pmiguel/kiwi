# ü•ù Kiwi

Kiwi is a Key-Value storage server, written from scratch in Go as a personal pet project ands exercise to learn the Go programming language. 

It aims to be as an alternative for Redis, and to support at least a subset of the commands provided by Redis, for familarity reasons. 
As added features, support for strong namespacing would be a nice to have addition.

- Supported Commands:
  - [x] PING
  - [x] GET

## Name Origin

ü•ù Kiwi in Portuguese reads as "Kivi", phonetically similar to Key-V. V in this case would stand for Value.
